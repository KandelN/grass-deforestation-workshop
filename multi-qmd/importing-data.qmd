## Importing Georgia Counties Data

Similar to the three raster modules above, there are three vector modules that we can use to import vector data:

- `v.in.ogr`: Imports vector data into the current or a new location
- `v.import`: Imports and reprojects vector data on the fly into the current location
- `v.external`: Links external vector data sources as a pseudo vector map

Since `Counties_Georgia.shp` is small, let's use `v.import` to import/reproject it into the NLCD location.

```bash
v.import input=Counties_Georgia.shp output=ga_counties
```

Reload the current mapset and add `ga_counties` to the map display.

## Linking NLCD Data

Now, we need to link the NLCD data sets as pseudo GRASS raster maps since the data is just too large.

```bash
r.external -e input=nlcd_2001_land_cover_l48_20210604.img output=nlcd2001
r.external -e input=nlcd_2019_land_cover_l48_20210604.img output=nlcd2019
```

We used the `-e` flag to extend the extent of the location to each data set.
