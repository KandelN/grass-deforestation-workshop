# Deforestation Study Using GRASS GIS
This repository hosts the materials for the [Deforestation Study Using GRASS GIS](https://workshop.isnew.info/grass-deforestation/) workshop in a Quarto webpage format. The workshop gives an introduction to GRASS GIS, its history, and guides participants in analyzing deforestation rates in Georgia, USA. The repository is structured to provide content rendered from a single `.qmd` file.

## Project Structure
Includes a self-contained single `.qmd` file that represents the entire workshop, which can be rendered into a single HTML page.

## Compiling the Quarto File
To compile the entire workshop into a single HTML file using the self-contained Quarto file, run the following command:
```bash
quarto render deforestation.qmd
```
The output will be a single `deforestation.html` file located in the same directory.
